## Notice

**I'll NOT publish this Chrome extension to the store.** If you want to use this, you manually install this extension after _you read the source code of this for your security and privacy_.
Chrome extension sometimes makes security holes. Unfortunately some of them have been done intentionally to rob our privacy. I think Chrome security system is the one of the most sophisticated function. I want to respect it and that's the why I won't publish this to the store and recommend you to see the source code of this before you install. Thanks for your reading.
